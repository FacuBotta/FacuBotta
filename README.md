# Hi Word!! ğŸ‘‹

I am currently a student in Web development. I don't have a lot of experience at the moment but I am an enthusiastic student. 
Every time I start a new project it's easy for me to lose track of time and spend hours and hours in front of the computer until I finish it ğŸ˜„ âš¡âš¡âš¡âš¡.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently studying in ADRAR Centre de Formation.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++, JavaScript, HTML, React, PHP, and more ğŸ˜„ 
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for a Stage
- âš¡ I love the code âœ¨âœ¨
