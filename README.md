# Hi Word!! 👋

I am currently a student in Web development. I don't have a lot of experience at the moment but I am an enthusiastic student. 
Every time I start a new project it's easy for me to lose track of time and spend hours and hours in front of the computer until I finish it 😄 ⚡⚡⚡⚡.

- 🔭 I’m currently studying in ADRAR Centre de Formation.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CSS, JavaScript, HTML, React, PHP, and more 😄 
- ⚡ I love the code ✨✨
